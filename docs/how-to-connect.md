# 3. Troubleshooting Connection Issues

## 3.1 “Connection Failed”

- Confirm the server is online  
- Ask the server owner if the server is restarting or backing up  

## 3.2 “Server Requires Password”
- Make sure you typed the password exactly

# 5. What to Expect

The server owner is using **VampireGuard**, which means:

- The server is automatically backed up  
- The server restarts cleanly  
- Downtime is minimal  
- World corruption is prevented  
- You’ll get a stable, reliable experience  

If the server ever goes offline briefly, it’s usually because:

- A backup is running  
- The server is restarting  
- The host is applying updates  

These windows are normally very short.

# 6. Need Help?

If you can’t connect:

- Ask the server owner for the correct IP/port  
- Ask if the server is currently restarting  
- Ask if a backup is running  
- Try again in a few minutes

# 7. Summary

To join the server, you only need:

```
<IP or DNS>:9876
Password (if required)
```

Use **Direct Connect** in VRising and you’re in.

Enjoy your time on the server!
